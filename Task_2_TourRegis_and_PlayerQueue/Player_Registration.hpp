/**
 * Player Registration Queue
 * This class manages the registration of players for a tournament.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Doubly-Linked List with Priority Queue Behavior:
 *     Wildcard > Early-Bird > Regular
 * 
 * insertAfter() - Inserts a new player node after a specified position.
 * isEmpty() - Checks if the queue is empty.
 * getSize() - Returns the current size of the queue.
 * registerPlayer() - Registers a new player and places them in the correct position based on their status.
 * popFront() - Dequeue the player at the front of the queue. (Highest priority player)
 * removeById() - Removes a player from the queue by their ID.
 * displayQueue() - Displays the current registration queue.
